## Customize a table home page

Sometimes you want different people to have a different view of a table. You might want users in one role to see a specific report (maybe a summary report or a report showing the high priority records), while the rest of your users get a listing of all records in the table. Or you might simply want to always show an advanced search form so that people can search for the exact records they want. If you have admin access to the table, you can do this.

To set what is shown on the table Home page:

1.  Open the table Home page settings. You can do this in one of the following ways:
    
    -   If you have clicked the table to display the table Home page, click the **Customize this Page** link on the page bar.
        
    -   In the sidebar, click a table. Click **Settings** on the page bar, then click **Table home page** in the User Interface section.
        
2.  Select one of the following options:
    
    -   **The same view for everyone.** If you choose this option, select the view from the dropdown: _[Default report](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570348881300-Setting-reporting-defaults-)_, _Advanced Search form_, or choose a report to show on the table Home page. If you choose the default report or a specific report, the table Home page may show [dynamic filters](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570135862420-About-Dynamic-Filters-), depending on how the report was configured.
        
    -   **A view based on the user's role.** If you choose this option, a row for each role in the app appears. Using the dropdown in a role’s row, select the view for that role. If you don’t set the view for a role or the view you choose is not allowed for that role, Quickbase uses the view you specified for Everyone.
        

Notes:

-   Grid Edit reports cannot be shown on the table Home page, and will not appear in the dropdown.
    
-   For performance reasons, if the report shown on the table home page contains more than 10,000 records, the Advanced Search form is shown instead.
    
-   The columns shown on the table Home page are based on the [default report settings](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570348881300) for the table.
    
-   If dynamic filters are turned on for the report show on the table Home page, the list of [dynamic filters](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570135862420) is displayed. If the report has no records, filters are not shown.
