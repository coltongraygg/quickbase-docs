## Using the app home page

The app home page is the first page you see when you open an application. An app manager can and should [customize the app home page](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570350362644-Customize-the-App-Home-Page-) by embedding reports, charts, and other web pages, providing active buttons, links, and search fields, and adding explanatory text. This page is where you should place any information your users will need on a daily basis.

Tip: If users will be accessing the app on mobile devices, read [tips for creating a mobile-friendly home page](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570339607572-Mobile-tips-for-app-developers-#dashboard).

When you're working in an app, you can return to the app home page at any time. To do so, click the **App home** button on the sidebar or the home icon at the beginning of the breadcrumb.

## Actions available from the app home page

The app home page offers access to frequently used information and common tasks for users and application managers alike.

### User actions

If you're a User, available actions will depend on how your app manager has customized your app home page. You may be able to:

-   **Print the app home page.** To print the app home page, click **Print** on the page bar.
    
-   **Open a table.** From the [table home page](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570309574420-About-the-table-home-page-), you can [add](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570336827668-Add-or-Edit-a-Record-) or [modify](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570336827668-Add-or-Edit-a-Record-#edit) records, [search for records](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570425947796-How-Can-I-Quickly-Find-Information-in-My-Application-), [create](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570299978772-Creating-new-reports-from-scratch-) or [modify a report](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570281029396-Edit-a-Report-), and perform other table-specific tasks.
    
-   **Open a report or chart.**
    
    Some apps automatically show some basic reports for each table, like List All and List Changes. Your app home page probably displays additional reports and charts created by your application manager and other users. ([Read more about reports](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570317429908-About-reports-and-charts-).) To open a report or chart, click a table in the sidebar, then click **Reports** to [access reports](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570309574420-About-the-table-home-page-) for that table.
    
    Alternatively, if an app admin has customized the app home page to include a list of reports, you can click a report in that list to access it.
    
-   **Expand a report or chart** to fill the browser window.
    
    To expand a report or chart on the app home page, click the **Expand** icon in the upper right corner of the report's title bar. The report will expand to fill the browser window. To return to the app home page, click the **Collapse** icon in the upper right corner of the browser window.
    
-   **Use an external web page** embedded in the app home page. You can expand the web page to fill the browser window.
    
    To expand a Web Page widget on the app home page, click the **Expand** icon in the upper right corner of its title bar. The web page will expand to fill the browser window. To return to the app home page, click the **Collapse** icon in the upper right corner of the browser window.
    
-   **Perform specific searches** customized by your app manager.
    
-   **Access a page** using a button or link.
    
-   **Add a record to a specific table** using a button or link in the page body.
    
-   **Add a record to any table** in the app using the **New** dropdown in the global bar.
    
-   View and select records or reports that you recently viewed, using the **Favorites** dropdown in the global bar.
    
-   Search for Quickbase help using the search controls available from the **Help** dropdown in the global bar.
    
-   Search for information stored in Quickbase, using the **Search** dropdown in the global bar.
    
-   Perform additional functions defined by your app manager, such as adding records to specific tables or accessing an external web app such as a trouble ticket system.
    

### App manager actions

If you're an App Manager, you can:

-   Do everything listed above, plus...
    
-   **Configure your app.** As manager, you have the power to design your app. Access configuration and management settings by selecting **App settings** in the sidebar.
    
-   **Invite users.** You can [Share](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570349592852-Sharing-apps-with-other-users-) your app with others.
    
-   **Add tables and import data.** These important functions are readily available to make it easy to get started with your app.
    
-   **Customize the home page.** You can design the home page so it's more helpful to you and your users. Add widgets such as a text area to post special announcements, special reports within the page (as pictured above), active buttons and links, search fields, even embedded external web pages. For example, feature a report that lets a user see a list of their own unfinished tasks when they open your application.
    
-   **Design a custom home page for each type of user.** Sometimes users end up having multiple [roles](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570323434516-About-Roles-) within an appl due to membership in multiple groups. You can design a custom report for each role. When you do so, Quickbase must decide which role takes precedence so that it displays the correct home page to that user. To do so, Quickbase considers each role's priority and presents the default home page for the role with highest priority. You can gain control over this issue by [setting priorities for roles](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570311906836-Reorder-Role-Priorities-).
