## What are connected fields?

Connected fields are fields within a [connected table](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570308461716-About-Connected-Tables-) that are connected to an app, service, or folder of CSV data. Connected fields appear with a ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572801052692/Plug_small.png) icon on the Field Settings page.

Since the data in connected fields comes from an external service, you canâ€™t edit the data in connected fields or add a new record to a connected table. This helps to keep your data in sync across multiple services and eliminate potential confusion about which system contains the most up-to-date information.

To add or update a record with the most current data available in the connected data source, [refresh your connected table](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570263852436-Refreshing-a-connected-table-).

You can [rename connected fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570253123348) and [change the field types](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570253123348-Change-the-Properties-of-a-Field-). You can also [connect more fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570325865236-Adding-more-connected-fields-) any time.
