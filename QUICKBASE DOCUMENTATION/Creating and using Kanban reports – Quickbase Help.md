## Creating and using Kanban reports

For anyone who tracks work that goes through stages or categories, Kanban reports let you visualize your data in cards that are easily moved between categories. For example, in a Sales Manager app your sales team can view their opportunities organized by funnel stage. Then they can drag an opportunity card from one stage to another as the opportunity progresses.

The columns in a Kanban report are based on values in a single-select multiple choice field or a user field. In our Sales Manager app example, the multiple choice field is called "Stage." Each time you drag an opportunity card to a new column, you change the value in that "Stage" field.

## Create a Kanban report

1.  From the sidebar, choose a table that has a single-select multiple choice field or a user field.
    
    **Note:** You will only be able to create a Kanban report if you have a single-select multiple choice field or a user field.

2.  Select **Reports** to open the reports and charts panel, then click **+New Report**.
    
3.  Select Kanban from the list and click **Create**.
    
4.  Add a name and description.
    
5.  In the **Reports & Charts** panel section, determine who can see this report listed in their panel. You can also choose to organize the report into an existing group in the panel.
    
    **About saving reports**
    
    You can save reports for others to see in the **Reports & Charts** area for a table if the manager of the app has granted you permission to do so.
    
    When you save this type of shared or common report, so that others can see it, you have several choices:
    
    -   **Everyone**. Everybody can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in my role**. Users who have my role can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in specific roles**. Users in any of the chosen roles can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **No one; hide it.** The report doesn't appear in the panel until you say otherwise. To see the report, create a bookmark in your browser.
        
    
    If your report is personal, choose **Only me**. Only you can see the report in the panel. You can't ever list it for other users. You can still let others open it by sending them links
    
    An app manager can also specify which reports a particular role can see at any time. To learn how, see ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/28605148400276 "This functionality  is not available to accounts on the Quickbase Essential plan.")[Specifying which reports a user can see](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570384081556-Specifying-which-reports-a-user-can-see-).
    
6.  In the **Card Groups** section, select the multiple-choice field or user field you want to use to group your cards into columns. For example, in your Sales Manager app, you can select the field called "Stage" to see your team's opportunities categorized by where they are in the sales funnel.
    
    1.  You can choose to show up to 15 groups. So if you your sales funnel has 20 stages but not every stage is relevant for your users, you can select the 15 you want to appear in your report.
        
    2.  **Note:** Each group will display the first 100 records as cards on your report.
        
7.  In the **Card Details** section, you can customize the three fields you want to display on your cards. Otherwise, the cards will display the first three fields from your default settings.
    
8.  In the **Filters** section, you can customize the data that displays. You can set initial filters to include only relevant data and also define dynamic filters that enable users to change the display to quickly get just the view of data that they need. [Read more about using filters.](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570137000980-Filter-Records-) For example, to customize which opportunities from your table appear in your Kanban report, add an initial filter.
    
9.  In the **Sorting** section, select the field to determine the order you want the cards to appear within your columns. If your app admin has enabled manual ordering for this table, you can choose to let users determine the vertical ordering by dragging cards within columns.

10.  To color-code your cards, select **Color-code cards using a formula**. [More about color-coding](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570391002260-Color-coding-in-reports-).
    

## Edit your Kanban report with the report builder panel

Beginning in 2022, Quickbase is introducing a report builder panel that will eventually cover all report types. The report builder panel duplicates the behavior of the report builder page, and allows you to make edits while looking at your report. Kanban reports are the first type of report to have access to this report builder panel. To open, it, click Customize this report near the top of the Kanban report.

 For more specific instructions on using the report builder panel, read our article on customizing your Kanban report with the report builder panel.
