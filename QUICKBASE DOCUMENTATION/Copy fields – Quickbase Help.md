## Copy fields

To copy a field and its contents:

1.  Open the table you'd like to customize from the sidebar.
    
2.  Select **Settings** in the page bar, then select **Fields**.  
    Or hover over the table name in the sidebar and select the **three-dot menu,** then select **Fields**.
    
3.  Locate the field you want to copy.
    
4.  Select the **Copy** icon ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/28604793979028) for that field, located in the rightmost column of the table.
    

A new field is added directly below that contains all of the data from the original field.

Copies are named using the original field name plus _copy_, _copy 2_, _copy 3_, and so on. To change the copied field's name:

1.  Select the field name to access the field properties.
    
2.  Type a name for the new field into the Label box.
    
3.  Select **Save**.
