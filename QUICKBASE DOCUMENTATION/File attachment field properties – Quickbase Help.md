## Revisions

Keep all revisions

 | 

Store every revision made to a document in Quickbase.

Note: Every version of a document counts toward the total file attachment size limit of the service plan your account is on. Over time, keeping every version of a document could significantly reduce the amount of file attachment space available to other workgroup members.

Maximum number of revisions for a file attached to a table = 100.

 |
| 

Keep the last _n_

 | 

Enter the number of document revisions that you want Quickbase to store in each attachment field.

Note: You can change this number at any time. If you reduce the number, the oldest versions of all documents in this field are deleted. For example, if the current number is 5 and you change the number to 3, Quickbase deletes the two oldest versions of every document with this field type.



 |
| 

Allow users to make older versions the current version

 | 

Let users view previous uploads to this attachment field. Users who can view the revision history can restore a previous version of a document and make it the current version.
