## To create a new table from scratch

You can add a new table by using the **New Table** option in your app, or by using [Visual Builder](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570376993300-Quickbase-Visual-Builder-).

### Using the New Table option

1.  From the [My apps page](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570317651220-About-the-My-Apps-Page-), open the app to which you want to add a table.
    
2.  Click **New Table** and select **From scratch**. The New Table dialog appears:
    
    ![new_table.png](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/12614191939476)
    
3.  Enter a name for the table, for example, Customers. This name will display in the sidebar.
    
4.  Enter a term to use for a record in the table, for example, Customer.
    
    Tip: When adding tables to an app, don't use a term for a single record that you already used in an existing table. Make the term unique for each table you add so that your users aren't confused when they try to add a record. If have a duplicate term or one you don't like, you can easily change it.

5.  If you don't like the icon chosen to represent the table, choose an icon from the **Suggested icons** field. If none of the suggested icons are suitable, use the **Icon** field to choose another icon. This icon will display along with the table name in the sidebar.
    
6.  Enter a description for the table. This description will display as hover text when you hover your mouse over the table name or icon in the sidebar.
    
7.  Click **Create**. Your new table opens for customization.
    
    Note: At this point, your new table is just a shell—it contains only built-in fields, and default forms and reports.
    
8.  Customize the table to suit your needs. You can add fields, set access permissions for all roles, create new reports and forms, and set up automatic email, among other things.
    

### Using the Visual Builder

1.  From the [My apps page](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570317651220-About-the-My-Apps-Page-), open the app to which you want to add a table.
    
2.  Click **Settings**, then click **Structure**. Your app opens in Visual Builder.
    
3.  Use the left column to drag and drop a new table onto the canvas, which adds a new table into your app:
