## Configure Date Fields

Date fields don't look or behave the way you want? Take control by editing the Date field's properties.

## Set the Default date to be today

When users fill out a data-entry form, you can help them out. Have Quickbase automatically enter today's date in a date field. The program doesn't prohibit other dates from being entered, it just gives users a head start. To automate this entry: On the field's Properties page, next to **Default value**, turn on the **Today** checkbox.

Tip: Users entering data in Quickbase can also take a shortcut. In any date field, press the "t" key. When you do so, Quickbase enters today's date. You can also use the keyboard to go back or forward one day. If there's a date in the field, select it and press "\[" to change the value to the day before the existing date, or press "\]" for the day after.

## Change the Date Format

Quickbase automatically displays dates in the following format: 07-05-2011. You can format the date differently, if you want. To do so, select one or more of the following options under Format within the Display section:

-   Show the month as a name results in this format: JUL-05-2011
    
-   Show the day of the week inserts the day of the week in front of the date. You'll see something like: Tuesday, 07-05-2011
    
-   **Don't show the year for dates in the current year** shows the date in the following format: 07 5, 2011. That may not look so smart, but the appeal of this format doesn't lie in its looks. This date display is intelligent enough to know what year it is. If a date falls in the current year, the date display leaves the year out. If a date falls in any other year, the year appears.
    

Tip: If you want you display the date in this format: date as: JUL 5, 2011, turn on both the Show the month as a name and **Don't show the year for dates in the current year** checkboxes. But remember, only dates that are not in the current year will show the year, and dates in the current year look like this: JUL 5.
