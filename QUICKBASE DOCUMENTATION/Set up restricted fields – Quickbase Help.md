## Set up restricted fields

> Access to this feature can change based on your Quickbase plan. Learn more about feature availability and plans in [Quickbase capabilities](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/21309804922004).

To restrict user access to a particular field in your application, you must first:

-   Determine which [roles](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570323434516-About-Roles-) limit the view and modify permissions for the fields.
    
-   Determine which fields you want to limit for each role.
    

Once you're ready to rein in field access, Quickbase gives you two ways to do so:

## To restrict access to one field:

If you're only restricting access to one field, this method is usually the easiest (though both will work).

1.  Open the table you want from the sidebar, then click **Settings** from the table card in the page bar.
    
2.  Click **Fields**.
    
3.  Click the field name to access a field's properties.
    
4.  Click **Advanced** to expand the section.
    
5.  In the **Permissions** section of the page, select the **Restrict access by role** checkbox.

6.  Select one of the following [access levels](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570382416276-About-Restricted-Fields-) from the list for each role:
    
    -   None
    -   View
    -   Modify
7.  Click **Save.**

To restrict access to several fields:

1.  Choose **Users** from the sidebar, then click **Manage Roles** on the page bar.
    
2.  Click the role whose access level you want to control.
    
3.  Click the **Permissions** tab.
    
4.  In the **Fields** column, click the arrow, then select **Custom Access** from the list. Quickbase displays a list of fields.
    
5.  If you have a large number of fields, you can search or filter fields to find the fields that you want:
    
    -   Type the name of the field in the **Search by field label** box to find the fields that you want.
    -   Click the **Show** arrow, then select the type of fields that you want to select. Learn more about [filtering and sorting fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570299455636-Filtering-the-Fields-List-).
