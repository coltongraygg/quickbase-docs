## Filter and sort the fields list

Some Quickbase users have tables with hundreds of fields. In these cases, filtering the Fields list to show a subset of those is often useful. The Fields list is accessed by choosing a table from the sidebar, clicking **Settings** from the the table card in the page bar, then clicking **Fields**.

## Filter by searching

The Search fields box appears at the top of the fields list. Type a search term to limit the fields shown to ones whose Field Labels contain that term.

## Filter by showing categories of fields

The Show dropdown contains a list of field types that can be used to filter the fields displayed for the current table. Choose one of the following options:

-   **All Fields** – Show all fields. Use this to remove any filtering currently in place.
    
-   **Text** – Show fields with Text types (including Text, Text - Multi-line, Text - Multiple Choice, and Multi-select Text).

Note that the field types in the Show dropdown will be grayed out and unselectable if no fields with those types appear in the current table. Hover your mouse cursor over the active field types to show how many fields of that type appear in the current table.

## Sort the field list

To sort the Fields list by a column, click the column header. By default, the Field Label and Type columns are shown. Click the Advanced Options link to show other columns that can be added to the Fields list. Select the columns to show and click **Save**.

Note: The order of columns in the default report is now set on the [default report settings](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570348881300-Setting-reporting-defaults-) page, and is no longer affected by the order of fields in the Fields list.
