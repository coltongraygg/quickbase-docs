## Connecting to Salesforce.com

Connect to Salesforce.com to bring data from Salesforce into a [connected table](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570308461716-About-Connected-Tables-) in your Quickbase app and keep it in sync automatically.

Note: Salesforce.com requires that your Salesforce.com account have **API access** enabled. Your user account must also have the **API Enabled** permission selected. If you're having trouble with your Salesforce connection, check with your administrator to make sure API access and permissions are enabled. See [Salesforce User Permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=admin_userperms.htm&language=en) for more information.

To connect to Salesforce.com:

1.  From the sidebar, click **New Table** and then select **Using connected data**.

2.  Name your table, click **Next**, and then select **Salesforce.com**.
    
3.  **Sign in to Salesforce** to authorize Salesforce to connect to Quickbase.  
    Salesforce.com uses Open Authentication (OAuth), an industry standard that securely grants access to data, while protecting personal information, such as your user name and password.
    
4.  Create your connected table. See [Adding a connected table to your app.](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570271750292-Adding-a-connected-table-)
    
    Note: It may take up to 10 minutes for newly-added custom Salesforce fields to display in the list of fields that you can connect.
