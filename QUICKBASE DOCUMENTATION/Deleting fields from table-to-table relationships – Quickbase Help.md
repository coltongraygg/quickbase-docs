## Deleting fields from table-to-table relationships

A relationship between tables can involve [many different fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570287263636-About-table-to-table-relationships-#fieldtypes). You can delete almost any field that is part of a relationship except a reference field. To delete a reference field, you must first [delete the relationship](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570433178260-Deleting-table-to-table-relationships-) itself. Then, within the details table, [manually delete the reference field](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570367639316-Deleting-a-field-).

When you delete a field, Quickbase deletes all the data in the field.

To delete a field that is part of a table-to-table relationship:

1.  Open the app that contains the relationship you want to to edit.
    
    If you created a relationship between tables in two different apps (a cross-app relationship), open the application that contains the child table.
    
2.  Open the table.
    
3.  Select **Settings**, then click **Table-to-table relationships**.
    
4.  Select the relationship that you want to edit. The relationship properties appear.
    
5.  Locate the field that you want to delete, and select the **Del** button. Usage information for that field displays.
    
6.  Select **Delete Field** in top right. A **Delete this field** dialog appears.
    
7.  Select the Delete button.
