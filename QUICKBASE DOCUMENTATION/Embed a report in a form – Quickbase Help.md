## Embed a report in a form

Use a report component form element to display related records from other tables on your form right next to the fields. The report component form element embeds a functioning report that allows users to:

-   View the report
-   View individual records
-   Edit individual records
-   Sort report records
-   Search and filter records

Report component field elements are great for giving users a view of related data while editing, viewing, and adding records. For example, you can add a report from your projects table to a task details form, so your team can see projects in progress while editing task records. 

## Adding an embedded report to your form

 To add a report component to your form:

-   Open the form element menu in the column where you’d like to embed your report
-   Select the report component
-   The report component settings menu opens automatically

If you close the report component settings menu you can open it again by selecting the report component in the column.

Start typing the name of the report in the search bar to search or choose a report from the Report drop-down. You can select reports from tables in your app or choose from tables in a different app in your realm by selecting **Choose a report in a different app**. In each table, select the report to display.

Select one or more options for displaying the report when records are being edited, viewed, and added. 

Turn on a subform to open report records on the same screen. Learn more in [Open report records on the same form using subforms.](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/17675931512980)

## Filtering related records

Filter related records by [report link](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570342656148) settings set for a specific field. Use the link to the **Report link field options** section on the **Properties** tab of the field settings. The report link will be automatically selected if a report link already exists on the form. 

You can also select **Do not filter for related records** if you don't want to filter related records.

## Previewing your embedded report

Preview your embedded report using the form builder [preview mode](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14942005711508).

-   Use the **Preview** toggle in the page bar to preview your form
-   Select the edit, view, or add preview mode or search for a specific record.

The embedded report functions as it would for your end users. In preview mode select a record to view or edit, sort records, show or hide columns, and view the full report.

Available embedded report functions depend on the permissions set for each of your end user roles.
