## Edit an Exact Form

Unsupported feature

Exact Forms are [no longer supported](https://community.quickbase.com/blog/the-qrew-blog-/exact-forms-is-being-retired/88688). Instead, check out [Document Creation](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/30225959071508)—our updated feature for easier document design and generation.  

-   Existing Exact Form Microsoft Word templates will continue to work indefinitely 
-   New accounts created after September 15, 2024 may not create Exact Form templates
-   In the second half of 2025, all accounts will lose the ability to create new Exact Form templates

Use Quickbase's exact form feature to generate documents that contain data from your Quickbase application. To learn how to download the Exact Forms Template and begin the process of creating an exact form, please read [Creating an Exact Form](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570390477588-Creating-Exact-Forms-).

Once you've downloaded the template, and created a form you can access it for editing at any time.  (Need help with the actual formatting? Read about [customizing exact forms](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570263029140-Customize-an-Exact-Form-)).

To edit an Exact form:

1.  Open the Exact forms template.
    
    To do so, double-click the **Quickbase Exact Forms.dot** file you downloaded from Quickbase. Read [Creating an Exact Form](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570390477588-Creating-Exact-Forms-) to learn more.
    
2.  Within Microsoft Word, select **Add-ins > Open from Quickbase**.
    
3.  In the dialog box that appears, enter your Quickbase user name and password, and click **Sign In** to sign in to Quickbase.
    
    Note: If your application exists on a custom URL, like _mycompany.quickbase.com_, you must replace the text that Quickbase inserts in the **Quickbase Domain** field with your own custom domain.
    
4.  From the **Quickbase Tables** list, select the name of the application and that contains the form you want to edit.
    
5.  From the **Quickbase Exact Forms** list, select the form that you want to modify, and then click **Open**.
    
6.  Make the desired edits. ([Read about customizing exact forms](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570263029140-Customize-an-Exact-Form-).)
    
7.  Save the form.
    
    If you want to save your changes to the existing form select **File > Save to Quickbase**. A confirmation prompt appears telling you that Quickbase saved your form.
    
    If you want to create a new form which features your edits, select **File > Save to Quickbase As**. Then select the application and table where you'd like to save it.
    
8.  In the **Exact Form Name** box, type in a name for your form (for example, "Letter"), and click **Save**.
