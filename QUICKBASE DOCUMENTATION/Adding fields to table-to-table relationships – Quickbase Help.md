## Adding fields to table-to-table relationships

You can enhance relationships between tables by adding additional fields, like [lookup](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570275339156-Creating-lookup-fields-) and [summary](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570321780372-Creating-a-summary-field-) fields. These fields can help users by showing them more information or letting them move back and forth between tables quickly and easily. Read [About table-to-table relationships](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570287263636-About-table-to-table-relationships-) to learn more about these field types. You can add one of these fields at any time.

3.  Select **Settings**, then click **Table-to-table relationships**.
