    ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572822814100)
    
3.  Use the **Left Element** and **Right Element** options to enter text or URLs to images (.gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png). If you enter text it will appear as-is in the header. If you enter a URL path starting with http:// or https:// and ending in .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, or .png, your image will appear. See [About adding images](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570329629076-Customizing-app-appearance#images) for more details.
    
4.  To make the text or image a hyperlink, click the link icon ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572851302164) .
    
5.  Use the **Colors** section to set the background and text color. You can enter a hex value, one of the 140 [HTML color names](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords) (for example, white, blue, green), or use the color picker.
    
    **Note:** The background color you choose is used for the main portion of the header. Quickbase automatically chooses a companion color for the tab row portion of the header. For example, this header is set to the HTML color name cornflowerblue and the inactive tabs appear in a darker blue:

## Adding images

If you want to add an image to your header or footer, the image needs to be stored in one of two places:

-   **Internet (external to Quickbase)** – Ensure your image uses a secure URL (one that begins with https).
    
-   **File attachment in an app record** – If you store your images this way, you must ensure that the table that stores these images is accessible by ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/19035826214548 "This functionality  is not available to accounts on the Quickbase Essential plan.")[everyone on the internet](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570308929428-Sharing-apps-with-Everyone-on-the-Internet-EOTI-).  
    You can get the URL of an image stored as a file attachment by opening the record. Click the link to open the attached file and copy the URL from within your browser's address bar. For example, here’s the URL to an image stored in a record in our Quickbase Help feedback app: [https://team.quickbase.com/up/bguzysv2x/g/rf/eg/va/5.png](https://team.quickbase.com/up/bguzysv2x/g/rf/eg/va/5.png).
