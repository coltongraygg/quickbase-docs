## Using preview mode to preview your form

The Quickbase form builder lets you see what your form will look like to end users as you design it. However, some form functionality is easier to test in preview mode. Switch to preview mode to see how your form will function for end users when they edit, view, and add records.

## Turn on form preview mode

To switch to preview mode, click **Preview** in the page bar.

In preview mode:

-   Form builder editing is turned off. This allows you to use the form as an end user.
-   You will still be able to make changes to your form name and form settings
-   You can find preview options in the preview mode menu
    -   The preview mode menu is collapsible, so you can see the full view of your form

## Search and select records in preview mode

To choose a record in your table to view and edit in preview mode:

-   Find a record in the preview mode menu by searching in the **Preview record** field or by selecting a record from the list.
-   Use **Previous** and **Next** to step through all the records in your table to find the record you want.

Changes made to records in preview mode are not saved, so you can test the fields and enter values without changing any data in your app. You can also test form rules in preview mode, the rules will execute as they would for users with your role permissions. 

## Form preview modes
