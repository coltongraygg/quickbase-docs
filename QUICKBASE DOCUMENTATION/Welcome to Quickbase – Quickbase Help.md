## Different types of Quickbase users

There are three types of Quickbase users.

-   **Account and realm admins** make decisions about how Quickbase is used at their organization. They make decisions that impact billing and assign permissions for creating apps and integrations. 
-   **App admins** use Quickbase to create web apps that track their processes. They determine who should access their apps, and assign permissions to app users. 
-   **App users** interact with apps that admins build to complete their work. The actions they can take in the app are determined by app admins. 

The type of Quickbase user you are determines how you'll get started using Quickbase. The following sections provide helpful links for each type of Quickbase user.
