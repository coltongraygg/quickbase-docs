## Add a connected table

To add a connected table:

1.  **Name your connected table**
    

-   Open the Quickbase app you're adding a connected table to.
    
-   From the sidebar, select **New Table** and then select **Using connected data**.
    
-   Name the connected table and select an icon to represent the table.
    

3.  **Select the data source to connect**
    

-   Select the source you want to connect to and enter the information required for Quickbase to connect to your data. This may vary, based on the source. For most cloud apps, you’ll be prompted for your user name and password, while for CSV files, you’ll create a folder and add your file.
    
-   **Select** a set of records to connect, for example, _Opportunities_.
    
    Depending upon the service, you can choose from ready-to-use collections of the most commonly requested data sets, **Optimized** for use with Quickbase, or if you're an **expert** user, you can select a table, as displayed directly from the service’s API.
    
    Either way, after you a select a set of records, we’ll show you the available fields, so you can connect just what you need. In most cases, an **Optimized** data set is the best choice.
    

5.  **Select fields**
    

-   Select fields on the left and drag them to the right to include them in your connected table. You can use [keyboard shortcuts](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570325865236-Adding-more-connected-fields-#keyboard_shortcuts) to move fields.
    
-   Arrange the fields in the order that you want to display the columns in your connected table and then click **Next**.
    

7.  **Set a filter and choose refresh options**
    

-   [Define a filter](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570365360148-Filtering-data-to-connect-in-a-connected-table-Help-) to limit the records that you connect. For example, connect only invoices from this year, rather than all invoices.
    
-   Select [refresh options](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570263852436-Refreshing-a-connected-table-) to define when and how to refresh the connected table.
    
    Refresh your table any time by selecting ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572832618644) **Refresh data** in the page bar.
    

Your connected table displays in the sidebar with the connected ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/30864993783060) icon. It may take a moment for Quickbase to display all the records in your connected table.

[Connected fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570265917332-About-connected-fields-) display the connected icon in the Field Settings page. You can [add](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570325865236-Adding-more-connected-fields-) or [delete](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570278916372-Adding-and-removing-connected-fields-) fields and [change the filter](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570365360148-Filtering-data-to-connect-in-a-connected-table-Help-) and [refresh schedule](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570263852436-Refreshing-a-connected-table-) at any time.

## You have a connected table — now what?

You can use connected data in your workflows and [build reports](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570327815572-Create-a-new-report-) across all your data from within Quickbase.

[Add fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570325865236-Adding-more-connected-fields-), [create relationships](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570269732756-Creating-table-to-table-relationships-), and [configure permissions](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570355458836-Configure-Permissions-for-a-Role-) as you normally would. Create lookups and summary fields and use connected data in your work flows, [reports](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570327815572-Create-a-new-report-), and [home pages](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570366229396-Create-an-App-Home-Page-).

You can [add more fields to your connected table](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570325865236-Adding-more-connected-fields-) or [delete fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570367639316-Deleting-a-field-). Like all Quickbase tables, connected tables automatically include 5 built-in Quickbase fields: Date Created, Date Modified, Record ID#, Record Owner, and Last Modified By. When you create a connected table, Quickbase automatically identifies a unique field to ensure accurate update of your data later.
