## Grouping form elements

Group elements to make them appear side-by-side on the same horizontal row. Grouping form elements is a great way to organize related fields.

For example, you may want to group a preferred name, email address, and phone number for clients on one row. Or, cost per unit, total, and budgeted amount for inventory materials. 

## Grouping elements

To create rows of grouped form elements, drag and drop one element on top of another.

-   Grouped elements will appear on the same row when the column width permits.
-   If grouped elements are too wide to fit within the column, the group will wrap to the next row.

To add more elements to a group you’ve already created, drag and drop the new element onto the group.

-   Dragging a group of elements on top of another group of elements will create a new group containing all elements from both groups.

Move grouped elements by dragging and dropping them in different columns in the same section.
