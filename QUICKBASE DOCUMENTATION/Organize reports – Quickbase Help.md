## Organize reports

Organize reports in the report menu to make them easier to navigate for your users. If reports are not organized, they are listed in alphabetical order. You can organize your reports to do things like:

-   Move the most popular reports to the top of the list
-   Group reports according to topic or purpose

## Requirements

App admins can organize reports in an app. This means in the app, your role must have:

-   Access level of **Full Administration**
-   _Edit Field Properties_ column checked for each table in which you want to organize reports

These options appear on the Permissions tab when you edit the role.

Note: If the app is in an account on the Quickbase Essential plan, only users in the Administrator role can organize reports.

2.  Select **Reports** under the table name to open the report menu.
    
3.  Select **Organize** to turn on organize mode. You'll see dragging indicators appear next to the report names.
