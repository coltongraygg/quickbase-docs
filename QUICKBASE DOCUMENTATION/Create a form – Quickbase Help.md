After you have a good idea of how you want users to interact with your form, it’s time to start building!

## Create your form

1.  Select the table to use to create your form and go to the **Table settings**.
2.  In the User Interface Column, use the **+New** button next to forms to create a new form.  
    This opens a blank form builder canvas. 

When you create a new form, there is one section and one column on the canvas.

## Add elements to your form

A [form element](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14942938504724) is a field or component. To add a form component:

1.  Select **Click to add here** to add a form element to your canvas.  
    This opens the quick add menu with a list of form elements for **Table fields** and **Components**. 
2.  Browse or search for the form elements you’d like to add and select them from the list. Select one or multiple form elements and click **Add selected**.

Note

Form elements are added to your form in the order they were selected, with the first element selected at the top.

![FormsAddElementsToFormJan92024.gif](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/27269565298196)

You can reorder elements by dragging and dropping them where you want them to appear on your form. Drag an element into an empty space in a section to create a new column. You can make changes to how your form element displays and behaves in the form element’s settings menu. Open it by clicking anywhere on the form element of your choice.

Tip

Quickbase generates field suggestions based on your table name and purpose. Check out suggestions by selecting the **Suggestions** tab. Select one or more fields, and then select **Add** to add suggested fields to your form and table.

> **Beta** This is a beta feature, which means we’re still developing it. Some functionality might change.

## Organize your form

### Group elements together

[Grouped elements](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14940102079380) display horizontally on the same row when column width allows and stay together if you move them. Drag and drop one element on top of another to group them. 

### Add columns, sections, and pages

#### Columns

[Columns](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14939033303828) divide your form elements in each section.

-   Click the **Add column** icon ![Screen_Shot_2023-04-17_at_10.38.31_AM.png](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/14932926449684)in a section to add another column.
-   Adjust the width by dragging the column border. **Note:** Grouped elements will wrap to the next line when columns are too narrow to display them side by side.
-   Change the color of a column and add a column heading in the column settings.

#### Sections

A [section](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14939033303828) is a visually distinct container for your form’s columns. Sections fill the full width of the form canvas and expand vertically to accommodate the height of the columns they contain.

-   Select the **Add section** button to add a new section to your form.
-   Reorder sections in the section settings. ![Screen_Recording_2023-06-01_Animation_of_a_section_being_moved_up_and_down_on_the_form_builder_canvas.gif](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/16167684009748)
-   Add a heading to help users understand what type of data they can find in each section. For example, in an inventory form you might create a section with the header _Purchase order details_.

#### Pages

[Pages](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14939033303828) display elements, columns, and sections on different pages that your end users can either tab or step through. For example, you can create a form that separates property overview information like square footage and year of construction from details like that date and time of recent showings. 

Adding two or more pages to your form will activate the form navigation at the top of the page. Click the page tab to jump between pages or scroll down to the page tab you want. You can drag and drop page tabs in the form navigation bar to reorder your pages. Pages can collapse and expand on the canvas to make it easier to build and edit complex forms.

-   In the page settings, you can:
    -   Choose to display pages as tabs or numbered steps.
    -   Add a color to the page tabs.
