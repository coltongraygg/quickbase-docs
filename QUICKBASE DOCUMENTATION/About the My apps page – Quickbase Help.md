## Apps shown on the My apps page

Any apps you can access show on the My apps page. This includes apps where you've been added as an independent user, or apps you can access because of membership in a [domain group](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570325278740) or [user group](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570287907220). 

Admins may choose to restrict some apps from showing on the My apps page. [Learn more](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570272520596) about this control. 

### Super users

[Super users](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570366459284) in a realm often have access to many apps. If you are a super user, you'll see a **Super user** control. 

When this control is **on**, the app list contains apps you can access because of your super user status. When viewing these apps:

-   You cannot hide apps
-   You cannot delete apps
-   Only [list view](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570317651220-About-the-My-apps-page#h_01JT9BJWF81A2N8Q2XDJJ1Y5JN) is available
-   You cannot see, create, or edit categories for apps

When the control is **off**, the app list contains only apps you've been granted explicit access to. This means you only see apps that you have been added to as an independent user or that you can access because of membership in a group. 

## Change the app view

View apps in either **Icon** **view** or **List view.** 

Icon view displays apps in tiles. List view displays apps in a table. When apps are shown in list view, Quickbase shows up to 50 apps per page.

Use the icon view/list view toggle to change views.

## App details included on the My apps page

When you view apps in List view, you see:

-   App—name of the app
-   Last visited—the date when you last opened the app
-   Date created—the date the app was created
-   Category—a category you create and assign to the app
-   Manager—the user who manages the app

Dates are shown in local browser time. 

When you view apps in Icon view, you see:

-   App name
-   App manager

List view shows a small version of the app icon. Icon view shows a larger version of the icon. App managers can [change the icon image and color](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570329629076-Customizing-app-appearance-#appicon) in the app settings.

In Icon view, there are different indicators that appear on the app icon:

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><img src="https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572851457172"></p></td><td><p><strong>Unused</strong></p></td><td><p>App has been shared with you, but you haven't opened it yet.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><img src="https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572837904020"></p></td><td><p><strong>Used</strong></p></td><td><p>You have used this app before, but don't manage it.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><img src="https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572858130196"></p></td><td><p><strong>Manager</strong></p></td><td><p>You manage this app.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
