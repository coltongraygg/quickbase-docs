Suppose you [restrict access](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570278329620-Set-Up-Restricted-Fields-) to a particular field for some users, but not others. Now you want to know exactly who can access the field. Since you assign access to fields by [role](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570323434516-About-Roles-), do the following to view users with access to restricted fields:

-   Look at the access level of each role.
    
-   Check which users are in that role.
    

## To view the access level of each role:

1.  Select **App settings** in the sidebar, then click **Roles**.
    
2.  Click a role in the **Role** column that you want to see.
    
3.  Click the **Permissions** tab.
    
4.  If **Custom Access** appears in the **Fields**, click the Edit icon (![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572866852756)) to view the access level of the restricted fields.
    
    One of the following access levels appears in the **Access** column:
    
    -   None
        
    -   View
        
    -   Modify
        
5.  Repeat Steps 2 through 4 for each role that you want to check.
    

## To view a list of users with access to restricted fields:

1.  Choose **Users** from the sidebar.
    
    The users who currently have access to your application are listed in the **Name** column.
    
2.  In the **Role** column, look for the name of the role that you know can access to restricted fields. Or, filter by role using the dynamic filters on the left side of the page.
    

## To find users if your list of users is large:

1.  Enter the name of a user in the Search users field at the top of the list of users.
    
    -   The **Search** box only searches the _Name_ column.
        
    -   The **Show** dropdown contains a list of user attributes that you can use to limit the number of users in the list.
        
2.  Choose one of the following options from the dynamic filters on the left side of the page:
    
    -   Under **Access**, click **App Access** or **No Access** to find users with or without access to applications in your account.
        
    -   Under **Role**, click any of the roles to find users with a particular role.
        
    -   User **Status**, click the type of status to find users with a particular status.
        
    -   Under **Show in User pickers**, click **Show** or **Don't Show** to display only users who are in, or not in, User Pickers.
        
    
    Deselect all filters to show all users.
    
3.  Click any column heading to sort the list of users by that column.
