## Adding New Fields

It's easy to customize your app to suit your needs. Add custom fields that fit your process. If youâ€™re working with a connected table, you can [add more connected fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570325865236-Adding-more-connected-fields-).

Tip: Say you're viewing a form within your app and you realize that you want to add a new field to it. You can create a field and add it to your form at the same time.

## To add a field to a form you are viewing

1.  Right-click the label (name) of the field above which you want to insert the new field.
    
2.  Select **Add a field after this one** from the menu that appears.
    

For each form in your app, you can specify that Quickbase automatically add new fields to it, prompt you, or never add new fields automatically. Whenever Quickbase adds a field to a form this way, it appears on the bottom. Or, you can [add fields to forms and reposition them](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570300784788-Design-a-Form-) at any time.

## To add fields to tables

You can add fields to tables using either table settings or [Visual Builder](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570376993300-Quickbase-Visual-Builder-).

### Using table settings to add fields

1.  Open a table, click **Settings**, then click ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/16954580140052) next to **Fields**. The **Add New Fields** dialog displays.
    
2.  In the **Field Label** box, enter a name for the field.
    
3.  From the **Type** list, select a field type that's appropriate for the data you want this field to hold. ([Read about field types](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570297480980-About-field-types-).)
    
4.  Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each field you want to add.
    
5.  At the bottom of the list, click **Add**.
    
6.  If the form is set with the property to **Ask whether the fields should be added to this form**, you may be prompted to add the field to forms.
    
7.  In the Fields list, click the name of the new field to open its properties page.
    
    The new field is highlighted, for example:

    Every field type has properties that are unique to it, which you can change at any time. For example, you can specify the format of a date field, or you can specify that a particular field is always required or is bold.
