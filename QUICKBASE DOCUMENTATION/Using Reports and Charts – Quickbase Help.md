## Using Reports and Charts

[Reports](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/sections/4572487109908-Reports) and [charts](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570319468308) are how you view your data in Quickbase. You can view reports on an app home page, a table home page, or send reports via email.

Reports and charts let you:

-   **Specify which records you want to see.** Filter out some of your records (by specifying matching values to use).
    
-   **Order those records exactly as you want.** Specify how records are sorted or grouped.
    
-   **Design the layout and set colors to suit your purpose.** Customize the layout and look of each of those formats. Rearrange and resize columns. Change the colors and labeling of charts.
    
-   **Ask the user.** Reports can provide users an opportunity to choose what data they want to see. You can [create a report that prompts users to enter criteria](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570432732948), and then display the results.
