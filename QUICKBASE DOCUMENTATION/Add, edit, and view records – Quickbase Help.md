Add data to apps by creating records. When an app builder creates a table, they choose what to call the records in that app.

To learn what a single record is called, review the text on the new record button in the page bar. For example, if the records in this table are called tasks, there is a **New Task** button.

Tip

Use keyboard shortcuts. The shortcuts that are available change depending on what you're doing.

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><strong>In View/Edit/Add mode</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Mac</td><td>Windows</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Save</strong></td><td>⌘ + S</td><td>Ctrl + S</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Save and keep working</strong></td><td>⇧ + ⌘ + S</td><td>⇧ + Ctrl + S</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Save and new</strong></td><td>⌘ +&nbsp;⌥&nbsp;+ N</td><td>Ctrl + Alt + N</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Save and view</strong></td><td>⌘ +&nbsp;⌥&nbsp;+ V</td><td>Ctrl + Alt + V</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Save and next</strong></td><td>⌘ +&nbsp;⌥&nbsp;+ N</td><td>Ctrl + Alt + N</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enter edit mode</strong></td><td>⌘ + E</td><td>Ctrl + E</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Add a new record

There are a few ways to add new records, you can:

When you add a new record, you an empty form opens. Start entering values into the fields. Asterisks (\*) indicate which fields are required.

If you try to enter data that is not in the correct format, the incorrect characters are rejected. Read our [Using forms with field value validation](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14966311161876) article.

## Save a record

When you have finished entering values there are different save options, including:

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Save action</strong></td><td><strong>Behavior</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Save</td><td>Save the record, and then return to the previous page</td></tr><tr><td>Save &amp; new</td><td>Save the record, and then open a new form</td></tr><tr><td>Save &amp; keep working</td><td>Save the record, and stay on the form</td></tr><tr><td>Save &amp; view</td><td>Save the record, and then view the record<span> in the default view</span></td></tr><tr><td>Save &amp; next</td><td>Save the record, and then edit the next record in the table</td></tr></tbody></table>

Note

People can open records in different ways and from different places. Because of this, Quickbase sometimes hides a save option if it doesn't make sense. For example, hiding the Save & next option if someone has the last record open and there isn't a next record.

## Edit a record

Find the record you’d like to edit on the table home page in the report that contains the record. You can select the **Edit** pencil ![Screenshot_2023-05-22_at_12.32.03_PM.png](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/15861776415124) on the record in the table or open the record to view and select the **Edit** pencil. Make your desired changes and select a save option to save the new values. 

While editing a record, you can 'also:

-   Discard changes by selecting **Cancel** in the page bar
-   Edit additional records in the table by using the **Previous** or **Next** options in the page bar
-   Delete records by using the **Delete record** option in the page bar (you only see this option if you have permission to delete records)

## View a record

Find the record you’d like to view on the table home page or in the report that contains the record. Select **View** ![Screenshot_2023-05-22_at_12.34.58_PM.png](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/15861823455892). 

-   View the desired record and use the **Previous** and **Next record** to view other records in the table.
-   Edit the record by using the **Edit record** pencil in the page bar.
-   Add a new record by using the **+New record** in the page bar.

App builders may make different fields appear depending on if you are adding, editing, or viewing a record.

## Add, edit, and view records with steps

App builders can set up different steps for entering data.

If you are **editing** or **viewing** a record, you can click on the numbers to navigate to the different steps. If you are **adding** a record, you can navigate using **Back** and **Next** found after the last section on the page or you can navigate using the **Back** and **Next** options in the **Page bar.** 

## Add, edit, and view records with tabs

App builders can set up different tabs for data.

Use the tabs to click through the form.

## Create new related record pop-up

When you add a new record, you can also add a record to a related table without leaving the form.

To do so:

1.  Click **Create a new record** in the drop-down of the related field.
2.  Create a record in the related table using the pop-up.
3.  Click **Save & close**.
    -   To discard the new record, click **Cancel**.

## Resolving field value errors

If you enter an unaccepted value in a field you either get a field value validation message, or your data is refused and not entered into the field. You need to enter the correct data or update the value to match the requirements of the field. Learn more about accepted data in our [Using forms with field value validation](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14966311161876) help article.

## Changes made while editing

If another user saves a change to the record you’re editing, you are prompted to choose which changes to keep. You can choose to resolve each affected field individually, or use **Keep all**/**Discard all** to bulk resolve conflicts in the affected fields.
