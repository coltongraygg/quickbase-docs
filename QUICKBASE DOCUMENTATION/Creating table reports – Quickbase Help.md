## Creating table reports

When you create a table report, you can choose which information to display in what format.

To create a table report:

1.  Select a table from the sidebar.
    
2.  Click **Reports** to open the reports panel, then click **+New report**.
    
3.  Select **Table** and then click **Create**.
    
4.  Add a name and description.
    
5.  In the **Reports & Charts** panel section, determine who can see this report listed in their panel. You can also choose to organize the report into an existing group in the panel.
    
    **About saving reports**
    
    You can save reports for others to see in the **Reports & Charts** area for a table if the manager of the app has granted you permission to do so.
    
    When you save this type of shared or common report, so that others can see it, you have several choices:
    
    -   **Everyone** — Everybody can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in my role** — Users who have my role can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in specific roles** — Users in any of the chosen roles can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **No one; hide it** — The report doesn't appear in the panel until you say otherwise. To see the report, create a bookmark in your browser.
        
    
    If your report is personal, choose **Only me**. Only you can see the report in the panel. You can't ever list it for other users. You can still let others open it by sending them links
    
    An app manager can also specify which reports a particular role can see at any time. To learn how, see [Specifying which reports a user can see](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570384081556-Specifying-which-reports-a-user-can-see-).
    
6.  Specify which columns to display in the report. You can use the defaults for this table, or choose **Custom columns** to select from a list of all available columns, plus choose the order you want either by clicking and dragging column names, or by using the ordering arrows.
    
7.  You can add custom data to your report’s display, filters, or sorting by writing a report formula. To add a report formula:
    
    1.  Select **Custom columns**.
        
    2.  In the Report Formulas section, select **Add a report formula**
        
    3.  Name your formula, select the type of formula from the drop-down, and write the formula. [Creating a report formula](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570272620052-Using-a-report-formula-)
        
    4.  If you want to add an additional formula, select **Add another report formula**. You can add up to 3 report formulas.

8.  In the **Filters** section, you can control which records display. You can set initial filters to include only relevant data and also define dynamic filters that enable users to change the report display.

9.  In the **Sorting & Grouping** section, set the report sort order and grouping of data using one or more fields.
    
10.  In the **Options** section, you can set one or more display and formatting options:
    
    -   **Hide totals & average**: Hides all totals and averages rows on the main table
        
    -   **Record Actions**: Choose to allow editing records from this report, allow viewing records from this report, or display only new or changed records
        
    -   **Format**: Select one of the following formats:
        -   Normal (default) displays in your browser
            
        -   Plain text
            
        -   Comma-separated values (.csv)
            
        -   Tab-separated values
            
        -   XML (flat)
            
        -   XML (structured)  
            **Note**: The Report Format feature is being retired, and has reached the end of support. [Find more information on feature retirements here](https://help.quickbase.com/user-assistance/quickbase_feature_retirement.htm).
