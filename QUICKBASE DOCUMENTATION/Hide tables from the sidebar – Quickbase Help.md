## Hide tables from the sidebar

You can customize apps by specifying which tables appear in the sidebar.

To hide tables from the sidebar in an app:

1.  Open the table you want to customize from the table bar, click **Settings** in the table card on the page bar, then click **Advanced settings**.
    
2.  Click **Advanced Table Settings** to expand the section, if needed.
    
3.  Click the **Show in the table bar** check box to clear it, and then click **Save**.
    
    This setting also disables the table name link and the **Reports** link when the user displays a report from the hidden table.
