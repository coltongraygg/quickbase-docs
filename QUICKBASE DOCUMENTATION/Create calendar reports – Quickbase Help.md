## Create calendar reports

To create a calendar report:

1.  Select a table in the sidebar.
    
2.  Click **Reports & Charts** to open the reports panel, then click **\+ New**.
    
3.  Select **Calendar** and then click **Create**.
    
4.  Add a name and description.
    
5.  In the **Reports & Charts** panel section, determine who can see this report listed in their panel. You can also choose to organize the report into an existing group in the panel.
    
    **About saving reports**
    
    You can save reports for others to see in the **Reports & Charts** area for a table if the manager of the app has granted you permission to do so.
    
    When you save this type of shared or common report, so that others can see it, you have several choices:
    
    -   **Everyone**—Everybody can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in my role**—Users who have my role can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in specific roles**—Users in any of the chosen roles can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **No one; hide it**—The report doesn't appear in the panel until you say otherwise. To see the report, create a bookmark in your browser.
        
    
    If your report is personal, choose **Only me**. Only you can see the report in the panel. You can't ever list it for other users. You can still let others open it by sending them links
    
    An app manager can also specify which reports a particular role can see at any time.

6.  In the **Calendar Events** section, choose how you want daily events to appear on the calendar:
    
    -   **What to base the calendar on**—Select what date field to use to mark the start of calendar events.
        
    -   **End date**—Select what date field to use to mark the end date for events.
        
    -   **Each day displays**—Select fields from your table to appear on each day’s events on the calendar, for example, you can have the project name and project manager appear on the calendar.
        
    -   **New records**—By default, users can start new records by double-clicking on the calendar. De-select to disable this option.
        
7.  In the **Options** section, choose one or more of the following display and formatting options.
    
    -   **Display calendar items**—Choose either a **link to display the event** or a **link to edit the event**.
        
    -   **Maximum events per day**—For month views, choose the maximum number of events to display on each day.  
        **Note:** If you add a calendar report to a dashboard as a widget, it will not retain this selection.
        
    -   When adding a calendar widget you can also use the dashboard's dynamic filters to display specific events.
        
    -   **Initial month to display**—Choose the initial month to display (current month, previous month, next month, or specific month).
        
    -   **First day of the week**—Choose to always use the app’s setting for the first day of the week or select a specific first day of the week for this calendar.
        
    -   **Calculated column**—Select **Define a calculated column**, then add a column label, choose a field type, and enter a formula. [More about columns](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570310548628-Columns-to-Display-)
        
8.  In the **Filters** section, you can customize the data that displays. You can set initial filters to include only relevant data and also define dynamic filters that enable users to change the report display.
