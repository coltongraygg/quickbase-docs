## Using dashboards

Use the dashboards feature to create a custom view of data from one or more apps, consolidating important information for your app users. You can create multiple dashboards tabs and configure each to display just the data you want to show.

Note

Dashboards are different than [home pages](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570350362644-Customize-the-App-Home-Page-), which provide an overview of a _single_ app.

## Dashboards update

A new version of dashboards is available. To try it out with the option to update to the new version:

1.  Unlock your dashboard to enter edit mode.
2.  Select **Try upgraded dashboards** for an interactive preview.
3.  During the preview, you can add and rearrange widgets on the new canvas. No changes will be saved to your dashboard.
4.  You have the option to upgrade all of your dashboard tabs to the new version or exit the preview to return to the original dashboard canvas.

Upgraded dashboards include:

-   More space for widgets
-   Unlimited vertical scrolling
-   Spacer widget to divide and organize widgets
-   Layout with dashboard tabs on the top of the page
-   **Add widget** button
-   Fast page loading through lazy loading filters
-   Accessibility improvements like tab order

## Creating a new dashboard

Note

Only app admins can create and edit dashboards.

To create your new dashboard:

1.  In your app, click **Settings** > **Pages** > **\+ New Page**.
    
2.  Choose **Dashboard**. A new empty dashboard appears.
    
3.  To name your dashboard, hover over the default name (**Dashboard...**) at the top. Click the pencil icon and rename your dashboard.
    

## Adding a widget

Use dashboard widgets to collect and display a wide range of information. This data can come from one or more apps within Quickbase, as well as from external sources. Learn more about [Dashboard widgets](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/25341875609620).

To add a widget:

1.  Select the **Add widget** button on the toolbar.   
    If you haven't upgraded your dashboard, hover over an empty cell in your dashboard, and then select the plus (+) icon.
2.  Select a widget type.
3.  Configure the settings for the widget in the Customize tab.

## Organizing your dashboards and widgets with tabs

Use tabs to organize your widgets, include more information on your dashboard, and better organize your related widgets.

To organize your dashboard with tabs, click the plus (+) icon to add another tab to your dashboard. To move, rename, or delete the current tab, click the ellipsis (...).

Duplicate widgets to create a new widget based on an existing one. When you duplicate a widget, you can add it to the current tab, and then move it to any tab.

## Locking your dashboard

When you are finished creating or editing your dashboard, click the lock icon ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572869524628) (top right). Your dashboard can’t be edited when it’s locked. If you decide to edit your dashboard later, just click the lock icon again.

## Sharing your dashboard

You can share your dashboard directly to collaborators or publish it on another website, depending on the permission levels you have created. For example, you could share a dashboard that shows facility performance with your colleagues.

To share your dashboard with others, click the share dashboard icon ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572855557908) (top right).

## Audit logs

Audit logs are a way of tracking how users interact with your app. On dashboards, Quickbase tracks when:

-   When a user visits a dashboard
    
-   Which reports a user saw
    
-   Updates are made to a dashboard
    
-   When new dashboards are created
    
-   When dashboards are deleted
    

This information is available to realm admins in the admin console.
