## What are List-User fields?

List - user fields let you assign a single task to more than one user in an app, or choose several users to take on the role of project lead.

Users in a list - user field are sorted alphabetically by first name. You can search for users in the list by typing any portion of the first or last name. List-user field contents are determined by the set defined for the field. For more information, read about the [default and custom user sets](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570277291284-About-User-Fields-#defaultset).

You can select up to 20 users in each list - user field. You can also select a user who is not currently in the default or custom set. If you choose to select another user, Quickbase displays the [User Picker](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570274572308-User-Picker-), allowing you to search for:

-   all Quickbase users
    
-   users in your company
    
-   other application users (optionally)
    
-   Quickbase groups to which you belong
    

Users in a list - user field are sorted alphabetically by first name. You can search for users in the list by typing any portion of the user's name, email address, or user name into the [User Picker](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570274572308-User-Picker-).

The content of the dropdown for a list - user field is determined by the set defined for the field. For more information, read about the [default and custom user sets](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570277291284-About-User-Fields-#defaultset). You can select up to 20 users in each list - user field.

## When can you use list - user fields?

For the most part, you can use list - user fields in the same way you use regular fields. You can filter reports, email notifications, and email reminders using these fields. You can sort and group reports by list - user fields. (See more about [how to filter records using list - user fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570261800084-Filtering-records-using-fields-with-multiple-values-).)

You can also use list - user fields as lookup fields when you create a relationship or cross-application relationship between tables.

## When can't you use list - user fields?

In some areas, Quickbase does not currently allow the use of list - user fields. These are:

-   conditional dropdowns
    
-   summary fields
    
-   shared value fields
    
-   key fields
