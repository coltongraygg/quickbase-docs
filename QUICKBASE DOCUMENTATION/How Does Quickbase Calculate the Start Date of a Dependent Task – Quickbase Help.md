## How Does Quickbase Calculate the Start Date of a Dependent Task?

Quickbase calculates the start date of a dependent task based on a full day and, by default, a five-day work week.

For example, if Task 1 will take 2.5 days to complete and it begins on 10-16-2003, it will end on 10-20-2003 (instead of 10-18-2003) because weekends aren't included in the calculation. This means that if Task 2 is dependent on Task 1 finishing, then the start date for Task 2 will be 10-20-2003 beginning at midday.
