## Use service accounts to manage connected tables

This article explains how realm admins and account admins can use service accounts to manage connected tables.

Individual users can [create connected tables](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570308461716-Creating-connected-tables) in their apps. To enable a group of users to manage a connected table, use a service account and assign users to it. This approach allows multiple users to manage the connection, ensuring continuity if the connection owner leaves the company, or if you need to shift responsibilities.

If you have already set up a dedicated user account to manage connected tables, consider converting it to a service account. This eliminates password sharing between employees and increases the visibility of which users are taking action under the account.

## Best practices for using service accounts with connected tables

-   All users creating connected tables should use a service account for collaboration and security.
-   Limit the number of users assigned to a service account. When a user no longer needs access to the service account, remove them.
-   Create multiple service accounts for different use cases, for example managing connected tables for different connected services, or for different workflows.
