## What is a Table report?

A table report is a list of records that consists of rows (each row is one record) and columns (each column is a [field](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570396310548-What-Is-a-Field-).)

You can customize a table reports to display the columns you want, filter records, and sort and group records. You can also draw in data from related tables.

Note: While table reports calculate totals and averages for you, these values do not actually exist in a field within Quickbase.  If you export the report data, the total/average data is not exported. You also cannot use this report-calculated summary data in formulas. Data must exist in a field to be exported and used in formulas. You can create [summary fields](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570321780372-Creating-a-summary-field-) in a parent table to store total, average, and other summary data from related detail records. You can include the summary fields when you run reports on a parent table, and if you export the report the summary field data is exported.  [Read more about table relationships](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570287263636-About-table-to-table-relationships-).
