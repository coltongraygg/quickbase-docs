## Deleting a field

Before you delete an app field, be absolutely sure that you won't need the field or any data it contains.

Important: When you delete a field, Quickbase also deletes all the data in the field, which canâ€™t be recovered. The field is also automatically removed from forms and reports.

Tip: If you must delete a field, you should understand the impact of the deletion. A good first step is to discover all the places that your app references a particular field. Quickbase shows you this information on the Usage page (mentioned in step 3 below).

## To delete a field

You can delete fields using either field settings or [Visual Builder](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570376993300-Quickbase-Visual-Builder-).

### Using field settings to delete fields

1.  Open the table that contains the field that you want to delete.
    
2.  Click **Settings**, click **Fields**, then locate the field you want to delete.
    
3.  Optionally, check the usage of this field:
    
    Hover the mouse over the field name, then click **Where is this field used?** in the popup that appears.

    The Usage page displays a list of the places where your app references this field. If you don't want to delete this field now, click **Cancel** to return to the Fields list.
    
4.  Complete one of the following tasks:
    
    -   To delete more than one field, select the checkbox next to the name of each field that you want to delete, then click **![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572816625044/deleteicon_12x12.png) Delete** at the top of the table.
        
    -   To delete a single field, click the delete icon (![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/4572816625044/deleteicon_12x12.png)), to the right of the field that you want to delete.
        
5.  Click **Delete** to confirm the deletion.
    

### Using Visual Builder to delete fields

1.  Open a table, click **Settings**, then click **Structure**. Visual Builder opens with the table expanded.
    
2.  Hover on the field, then click the edit icon:
