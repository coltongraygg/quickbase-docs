## Making fields required

When you require a field, users canâ€™t save a record until the value is entered. You can make a field required across your entire app or only when it appears on a special form.

## To require entries in a field across your entire app

You can require fields names using either field settings or [Visual Builder](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570376993300-Quickbase-Visual-Builder-).

### Using field settings to require fields

3.  Click **Save**. Required fields are shown with a red asterisk next to the field's name on the fields page. For users, a red asterisk appears next to fields on forms to indicate that values are required.
    

### Using Visual Builder to require fields
