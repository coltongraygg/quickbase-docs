## Field mapping

Under Maps to this Quickbase field, select a Quickbase field that you want to map to an iCalendar field.

Note: You must map iCalendar fields with an asterisk (\*) to Quickbase fields.

For example, under Maps to this Quickbase field, you can map the iCalendar Starting time to one of the available Quickbase fields. Don't see the field you want? That's because each item in the list accepts only fields of a specific data type.
