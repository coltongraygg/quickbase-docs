## Using the Quickbase time zone helper

Quickbase makes it easy to calculate the correct time and date when collaborating across time zones with the Quickbase time zone helper. The time zone helper appears next to the time of day or date/time field and is designed to help you convert time without leaving the field. Use the time zone helper to:

-   Convert time and time zone to app time and add it to the field you're editing
-   Enter times that are different from your app time zone    

## Add the time zone helper to your form

The time zone helper works on

-   time of day
-   date/time fields.

Turn the time zone helper on by selecting **Show time zone** in your **F****ield settings** on the **P****roperties** **tab** in the display section.

You can find field settings in your table settings, or by selecting **Field settings** in your time of day or date/time form element settings in the form builder.

-   Select time and time zone you'd like to convert to app time using the time and time zone fields in the helper. Type to search in the time zone field using the time zone abbreviation, full name, or associated country. Use the drop-down menu to scroll the list of available time zones.
-   Once you’ve made your selections, the converted time and/or date will be automatically added to the field. You can find the equivalent time in the time zone you selected labeled **Local time** near the field.

For example, if you were entering details for a scheduled call with a client in Arizona (MST) time zone at 11am and you want to enter the correct time in your app’s time zone, Boston (EST), into the time field, you would select the client’s time zone and 11am in the time zone helper to see the time converted into Boston (EST) time zone in the field. You should see the time of the call in Arizona (MST) time zone near the field.
