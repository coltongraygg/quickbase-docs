## Testing connections

You can only test a connection if you are the connection owner.

To test a connection:

1.  Click the user dropdown on the Global bar, then click **My preferences**.
    
2.  In the **My Connections** area, select the connection you want to test.
    
3.  Click **Test Connection**.
    

If your connection is not working, you can click **Reauthorize** or update connection settings and then click **Save**. You can also re-name your connection.
