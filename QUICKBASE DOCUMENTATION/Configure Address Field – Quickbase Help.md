## Configure Address Field

The Address field has some unique property settings. To configure an Address field:

## Basics

In **Label**, enter a title for the Address field, e.g., Billing Address.

In **Type**, Address should appear.

To require a complete address for each record, select **Required**.

## Address field options

In the **Format** dropdown, select whether the Address field is restricted to _United States_ or _International_.

If you have selected _United States_, the option below it will become the **States** selection menu. You can select specific states to restrict the states that may be entered. All states are available by default. You can restore to the default by clicking **Reset States**.

If you have selected _International_, the option below it will become the **Countries** selection menu. Here, you can enter the countries to which you wish to restrict your addresses. The field is initialized with over 200 countries. To return to this default set, click **Reset Countries**.

You can change the width of the input boxes. The default setting, 60 pixels, is optimized to allow a map to appear next to the field, but this can, of course, be changed to suit your needs. The width of the **Postal Code** subfield is always 50% the width you designate. The width of the **Country** listbox is fixed and will not be affected if you change the width of the other subfields.

You can also select the default map type to display on forms.
