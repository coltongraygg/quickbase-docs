## Managing users in an app

You use the Users page to add users to your application and control their access. You also use this page to add and manage groups and domain groups.

To open the page, click **Users** on the sidebar. You can see how a user was granted access to your app, as an _individual_ or via _membership in a group_. Group members from a domain group don't display here. For users given access to an app as individuals, the date they were invited to the app displays.

## Managing application users

Use the following options to add, modify, manage, and remove users from your application. Click the checkbox next to users name to select that user, select multiple users, or select all users on that page by clicking the checkbox at the top. To manage users in groups, select either Membership in a Group to view the individual members or a group or select Group to view the Groups by name.

## Find users on the Users page

To find users or groups on the Users page, type your search criteria in the **Search users** box or use the Filters at the left of the table.

-   Search for a user using email address or user's full name. As you type, Quickbase filters the list, showing possible matches with every character you type.
    
    Note that, when you search for users, Quickbase searches the data that is displayed in the Name column. For example, if you search for the user by typing in a role, you will not find the user.
    
-   Click a filter to show only the users that match it. Clicking multiple values in a category shows users that have any of those values. Clicking a value in two different categories shows all the users with both those values. You can filter by:
    

-   -   Users with individual access, users with group access, users with no access
        
    -   User status or role
        
    -   Users who are shown in User pickers
        
    -   Users who belong to a specific group  
        **Note**: Sometimes, Quickbase forms include User fields that are actually reference fields from other tables. For instance, imagine you're working with a project management application that includes two tables: Tasks and Resources. If you create a relationship between these two tables, Quickbase will create a reference Resources field within the Tasks table. When you create a task, you'll be able to select a resource using this reference field. Your Default Set settings DO NOT apply to User fields that are reference fields. In this case, the Resources reference field will display all resources in the Resources table, regardless of which users have been added to the Default Set.
        

## Managing Users

The Manage Users page offers access to number of different features that are related to managing users. You can organize the list of users who appear in User field dropdowns across the entire application (the [Default Set](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570277291284-About-User-Fields-)) using theÂ Show in User pickers column.

Use the controls on the page bar to:

-   [Import users](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570390204180-Importing-Users-)
    
-   Manage roles
    
-   [Manage groups](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570287907220-What-Is-a-Group-)
    
-   [Convert](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570401083924-Convert-Placeholders-to-Real-Users-) any [placeholder users](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570379205908-About-Placeholders-) into real users.
    

You can set controls that apply to only the users on that page. By default, Quickbase displays 500 users per page. You can increase that to 1000 users by clicking the down arrow next to 500 and selecting 1000.
