## Building forms in Quickbase

Records are added, edited, and viewed in your app using forms. You can use the [Quickbase form builder](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14932802607636) to customize and arrange fields on forms to create the perfect experience for your app users. When you build forms with Quickbase, you'll be able to

-   Group fields into rows, columns, sections, and pages
-   Add color, reports, and text
-   [Assign default forms](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/15153300583444) to specific user roles and change how a form looks for a user, based on their role 
-   Create [form rules](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/15342169525396)

## Designing forms

The Quickbase form builder gives you a WYSIWYG experience which means, what you see as you’re building your form is what your end users will see. 

**Form elements**: Table fields and components are added to your form as form elements. After you add an element to your form, you can drag and drop to organize them and edit how they look and behave in the [custom settings](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14942938504724). 

**Columns, sections, and pages**: Organize form elements in columns, sections, and pages.

-   Pages can have multiple sections.
-   Sections are visually distinct containers on a page. You can customize your sections to be collapsible, so your end users can collapse or expand sections when there are two or more on the page.
-   Add up to six columns per section. You can adjust column widths. Column height is automatically adjusted based on the number of elements in the form.  

**Form builder canvas**: You will design your form on the form builder canvas. Each new canvas comes preloaded with a section and column, so you can easily start adding form elements. 

The form builder also has a [preview mode](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/14942005711508). Use preview mode to preview how your users will add, edit, and view records with your form without making any changes to your app data.

## What can you do with a form

Forms are a powerful way to add structure to the data you ask users to enter. These are additional features that will give your end users a better experience and help you gather the data you need: 

-   **Collaborate with multiple app users**. App users can make edits to the same record at the same time. If this happens, they will see a message that another user saved changes while they were editing. 
    
-   **Time zone helper** helps users convert times in date/time fields on the form.
    
-   **Required fields**. Mark fields as required so users don't skip important data by mistake. Users will see error messages if they don't enter data or enter data in the wrong format (for example, try to add a name to a number field).
    
-   **Customized help text**. Add additional help text and rich-text components to share instructions and information.
    
-   **Add new related records in related tables**. Add data in related tables without leaving the form. When a form includes a field for records from a related table, use the related record pop-up to create a new record in the related table.![Screen](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/16308339182484)
    
-   **Upload files**. Upload one or multiple files to forms using file upload fields. Drag and drop the file into the form or select files.
    

## Where you can use forms

Forms are the entry point to add information to an app. With Quickbase forms you can open them in an app, or share the form in a different context. Share a form to do things like:

-   Embed a form on a webpage
-   Open just a form using a link. That is, open a Quickbase form without the Quickbase navigation. 

This makes it easy to collect data without people needing to create a Quickbase account. Of course, the permissions set up for a form still apply, but if you have a form that is accessible to _Everyone on the internet_, you can send the link or embed the form.
