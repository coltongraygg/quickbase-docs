    Tip: You can also create a report that displays in **[Grid edit](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570328849812-Grid-edit-)** mode. This is a handy tool for situations in which users will need to edit or add many records at once. To do so, just select Grid edit as your report type. (Users in roles with limited permissions may not see this option.)
    
5.  Select **Display** in the page bar to preview your report.
    
    After displaying the report, if you want to make more changes, click the **More customization options** icon at the top of the page to return to the report builder.

6.  Once you’re finished customizing, you can save the report. Depending on your role in the app, you can specify who else can see and use the report.
    
    **About saving reports**
    
    You can save reports for others to see in the **Reports & Charts** area for a table if the manager of the app has granted you permission to do so.
    
    When you save this type of shared report, so that others can see it, you have several choices:
    
    -   **Everyone**. Everybody can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in my role**. Users who have my role can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **Users in specific roles**. Users in any of the chosen roles can see the report in the panel.
        
    -   **No one; hide it.** The report doesn't appear in the panel until you say otherwise. To see the report, create a bookmark in your browser.
        
    
    If your report is personal, choose **Only me**. Only you can see the report in the panel. You can't ever list it for other users. You can still let others open it by sending them links
    
    An app manager can also specify which reports a particular role can see at any time. To learn how, see ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/28605368273940 "This functionality  is not available to accounts on the Quickbase Essential plan.")[Specifying which reports a user can see](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570384081556-Specifying-which-reports-a-user-can-see-).
