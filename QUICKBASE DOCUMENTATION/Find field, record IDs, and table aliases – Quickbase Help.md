## Find field, record IDs, and table aliases

When you use a query in a formula query function, you may need to reference field and record IDs, and table aliases. 

## Find field IDs

1.  Open a table and select **Settings** from the table card in the page bar.

2.  Select **Fields**.  
    On the Fields setting screen, you can view Field Label, Type, Relationship, and Field ID.
    

## Find record IDs

The record ID field is automatically created for each table and the record ID# is always assigned to field ID 3.

-   To find the record ID, search for field ID 3. 
-   By default, the record ID field name is Record ID#
-   To see the record ID field when you view a record, add it to a form (see [Design a form](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570300784788))
-   To add the record ID field to a table report, see [Creating table reports](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570353430420)

## Can't find the record ID?

Someone may have changed the default field name. Since the record ID is always field ID 3, you can locate which field is serving as the Record ID# by identifying the field with ID 3.

## Find a table alias

It's possible to search records from other tables using the table ID; however, it is best practice to use the table alias.

1.  Open a table and select **Settings** from the table card in the page bar.  
    ![Table card is second item in breadcrumb, directly after the home icon](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/34013162953748)
2.  Select **Advanced settings**.  
    The table alias appears in capital letters at the end of the **Advanced Table Settings** section.
