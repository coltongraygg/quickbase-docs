## Provide field help

You can easily provide guidance by attaching help to any field. When you do so, Quickbase displays a question mark icon next to the field. When a user hovers over the question mark, a yellow tool tip appears, containing whatever text you want.

To add help to a field:

1.  Open the table you want to customize from the sidebar. Select **Settings** from the table card in the page bar bar, then click **Fields**.
    
2.  Click the field that you want.
    
3.  Click the **Properties** tab.
    
4.  In the **Field help text** box, type whatever text you want to appear when you move the mouse over the **i** (![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/19008617800724)) icon.
    
5.  Click **Save**.
    
    Note: Field-level help appears on forms.
