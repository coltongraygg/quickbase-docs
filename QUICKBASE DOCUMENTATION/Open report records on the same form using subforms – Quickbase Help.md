## Open report records on the same form using subforms

Builders use subforms to control where and how people edit or view records in embedded reports. This article explains subforms and how to add them to forms.

## Understand subforms

A subform is a way to view and edit records in an embedded report without navigating away. Subforms open over the form you're on. This makes it faster and easier for end users to view details and create records. Subforms can be opened on forms with or without tabs and sections.

When someone opens a subform, they can still navigate between steps and view tabs. From the subform, they can also navigate between the records in the embedded report.

In a subform, people can't create a new record at the same time they're creating the parents. Also, they can't view or edit a record in a subform if the same record is already open somewhere else.

When you turn on a subform to a form you can configure things like:

-   Buttons that display
-   What form to open in the subform

## Turn on subform for an embedded report

In order to create or view new records in a subform, you must set a report link field in the report component settings. 

When you edit or create a form, you can add an embedded report. After you turn it on, you can configure advanced options for a subform.

1.  Add an embedded report to your form.
2.  Select the report, and then expand the Advanced options.
3.  Select the **Open record in subform** checkbox, and then select which form to open.
4.  Select if you want to show the toolbar and the create record button.  
    Showing the create record button allows people to create new records in the subform.
5.  Save your changes.
