## Rich-text components in forms

You can add a block of text to your form using a rich-text component. Use rich-text components to add non-editable text to a form to display to your app users. Rich-text components are customizable and there are many ways you can utilize the component for your end users needs.

For example, add detailed instructions for completing the form like scheduling guidelines for assistants. Use a rich-text component to inform new patients about the documentation they’ll need to complete their new patient paperwork or add recall information on a construction material inventory form.
