## Deleting tables

When you delete a table, you permanently remove the table and its contents.

Important: You can’t recover the data in a table once it has been deleted. To remove a table from an app without deleting it, [move it to a new app](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570403369492-Remove-a-Table-from-an-Application-), instead.

## Before you delete a table

Before you delete a table, you may want to create a new, comprehensive report to review its contents to make sure you don't delete valuable information.

To display a comprehensive report:

1.  Open a table, click **Settings**, then click ![](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/article_attachments/18340949152660) above **Reports & charts**. The report builder opens.
    
2.  Make no changes to the settings, then click **Display**.
    

Important: If the table is related to other tables, [delete all relationships](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4570433178260-Deleting-table-to-table-relationships-) before you delete the table. If you don't delete all relationships, you can leave orphaned lookup and reference fields behind in the remaining tables. If you have any formula fields that refer to the relationship's lookup fields, they won't work after you delete the relationship.
